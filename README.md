# Domain-Driven Design

Domain-driven design (DDD) is a major software design approach,focusing on modeling software to match a domain according to input from that domain's experts.
Under domain-driven design, the structure and language of software code (class names, class methods, class variables) should match the business domain. For example: if software processes loan applications, it might have classes like loan application, customers, and methods such as accept offer and withdraw.

Domain-driven design is predicated on the following goals:

- Placing the project's primary focus on the core domain and domain logic
- Basing complex designs on a model of the domain
- Initiating a creative collaboration between technical and domain experts to iteratively refine a conceptual model that addresses particular domain problems.
- Criticisms of domain-driven design argue that developers must typically implement a great deal of isolation and encapsulation to maintain the model as a pure and helpful construct.

While domain-driven design provides benefits such as maintainability.
